ROSMover for Android

The application was primarily designed for our experimental faculty robot - TB2. Designed user interface shows a video stream coming from the Kinect mounted on the robot and the current 2D map. The robot movement is controlled by a Street View like user interface while rotation of the robot in place is solved by specific touch gestures on display.
